              <p class="card-text">Research suggests that a well-nourished child who starts the day with breakfast is more likely to be at school, be a better learner, and be willing to participate in the classroom.

Tight budgets for low-income families and busy morning schedules may force many students to arrive hungry at school.</p>

Also, they often affect the food supply chain in the area by various means resulting in food insecurity for the victims. Hence a distribution program for emergency food is a vital part of any disaster relief response.</p>
